During a hackathon with the theme of fitness I created an application that allowed the user to input/update/delete their information, select what level of fitness they think they are at, beginner, intermediate or advanced and connect with other users. 

languages used: JavaScript, Angular, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, JSON
